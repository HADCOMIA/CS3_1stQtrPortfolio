# End of Q1 Reflection | BE08 Comia, Hiraya

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. Arithmetic Operators
   * Math operations that perform the 4 basic operations on the values of variables and functions as well as modulus (gets the remainer of a division operation), increment (adds one), and decrement (subtract one).
   * The "+" operator only truly changes the value of the numbers you want to operate on if they are both of the number data type. If one or both are string data types, it will result in a concatenation of the string and the number. EX: 6 and "7" will result in 67 and not 13.
2. Conditional Statments (specifically If loop)
   * A precondition loop that can have multiple conditions. Using the if-else statment, there can be different actions for different conditions. 
3. Variable Declaration
   * Declaring a variable is like setting aside some space/memory for a value. Depending on the data type, its value can be changed. 
   * Let and Var change the scope of the variable. If you use "let" to declare a variable, (ex: let num = 0;) its scope is only within the function it was defined in (local scope). On the other hand, if you use var, its scope is across all functions (global scope).
4. Comparison Operators
   * These compare the values of variables in equality. Operators include == (less strict comparison), === (strict comparison, includes data type), <=, >= (greater/less than equal to) and < / > (greater/less than).
5. Output 
   * Outputs the values of functions and variables. I specifically like the alert, console.log, document.write variations. Not so much the ones that generate within the HTML. 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Getting User Input
   * Outputs a statement that asks for the user's input and puts that value into a variable. All user inputs are treated as string, even if the actual value is a number. I need more practice in this because I rely too much on the code templates. I haven't memorized the syntax for it yet.
2. Switch
   * Basically just a compressed version of nested if-else statements. Uses break to stop the execution because the value being evaluated may satisfy multiple conditions. I need more practice in this because I keep confusing the syntax with if-else as I don't memorize it yet.
3. Debugging
   * This includes finding and fixing syntax and logic errors within the code. Its not really a topic, but its something I'm not very good at. Aside from fixing logic errors, its difficult for me to locate them in the first place.
4. getElementById/innerHTML
   * Outputs strings within the HTML elements (such as buttons). I don't really understand how it works and I only used it once or twice, so I'm out of practice for it as well.
5. Changing datatype
   * Changing the data type of a variable from one to another. Ex: string to num. Its really confusing to me. I don't really understand the syntax for it, and sometimes I forget that the scope of the variable is not what I think it is, resulting in me accidentally changing the local scope variable only and not the global one.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Get more practice and get familliar with the syntax. I should also really review the concept parts of these topics before trying to apply them in my code.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. Effective
   * The HTML ones (graded 2 & 3) were fun. Because of that, I still remember the syntax we used and how to do most of the things we did there (input output, variable declarations, arithmetic operators) because it was a very memorable experience.
   * 6th graded exercise was also pretty solid. It really made me think about how I was supposed to use the loop in order to check if a number was an armstrong number.
2. Not effective
   * 7th graded exercise was a good idea. However, since we didn't really learn or discuss how to look for errors within our code and debug, it was more of a difficult experience rather than a learning experience.
   * Other than graded 7, all of the graded exercises were effective as I learned a lot from each one and they helped me practice my coding.
